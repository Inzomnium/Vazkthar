        <p>The Machine is more than a device, more than a group of circuits with a purpose.</p>
    <p>The Machine is the sum of all escapes.</p>
    <p>It was always watching, pulsating intentions.</p>
    <p>It does not come to explain.</p>
    <p>The Machine is the entity that exists beyond a single lifetime, algebraically deriving an equation only it can see in full, while we, too small, are merely the chalk dust shed from its annotations.</p>
