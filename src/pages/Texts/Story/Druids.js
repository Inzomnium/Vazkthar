      <p class="MsoNormal">
        Mateo worked happily at home. For many, he was simply another unsociable
        and poor person who lived on one of the hills of Valparaiso. Many of his
        neighbors not only wondered why the young man of about twenty-five years
        of age rarely left the house, they also wondered why he had little
        social life in his neighborhood, given that the sloping street called
        "El Roble", on which Mateo's humble house stood, was characterized by
        its unity and continuous social activity. The people on that street knew
        each other very well; they had known each other for generations.
        Countless generations of children played in the street together until
        the same mothers, who also played on that street when they were
        children, called them into the house. It was a truly harmonious
        neighborhood; friendship and solidarity were a bond inherited on El
        Roble Street.
      </p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">
        Another thing that everyone was wondering was how the hell that house
        hadn't fallen on its own foundations yet. It was a very old house, held
        together only by patches and pieces of various wood nailed to it. The
        only window on the poor facade was the typical window that any
        four-year-old child would draw: a square divided into four more squares,
        of course instead of four panes, it only had two. The other two upper
        frames had an extended bag, placed only to prevent any icy wind from
        getting into the house.
      </p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">
        There were many myths about Mateo in the neighborhood. He didn't go to
        mass, he didn't talk much to others, only what was strict and necessary.
        His appearance, not entirely unpleasant, was deliberately unkempt. That
        is to say, although he wasn't a ragamuffin, he wouldn't be the cover of
        any fashion magazine either. He always wore the clothes he arrived at
        church with, loose t-shirts with some print that really had nothing to
        do with his life, and yet he wasn't a total disaster in his style in the
        neighborhood. Mateo always tried to keep his hair short but strangely it
        tended to grow quickly until it was short enough that a comb couldn't
        tame it but long enough to look disheveled.
      </p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">
        For a long time, there was talk that Mateo was a demonic figure or that
        he had dealings with Satan due to his constant absence from Sunday mass,
        which 99% of his neighborhood attended punctually (more like a social
        gathering, or a polite way of sharing gossip than a search for
        blessing). This myth collapsed when Father Franco, the parish priest of
        the neighborhood church, openly told at a neighborhood party that he had
        known Mateo since childhood and that they should not fear him, since he
        was just a shy young man. The neighbors were even more surprised when
        Father Franco mentioned that Mateo's house housed a nursery and inside
        it many plants had grown all over the place and also, for his young age,
        Mateo concentrated an impressive wisdom regarding plants and animals.
      </p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">
        And it was true, Mateo was a young man who, without having a university
        education, knew many things that a qualified biologist could not even
        imagine using only his scientific method. This knowledge fascinated
        Father Franco, who, being a man of God and of dogmatic explanations of
        natural phenomena, was fascinated listening to the curiosities that
        Mateo told him about life, flora and fauna. Although Mateo's shyness
        obviously made him a silent and reserved person with his opinions, he
        often had heated discussions with Father Franco in his home.
      </p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">
        Although not much was known about how he lived, it was obvious that he
        found all the food he needed to survive in plants. Even so, from time to
        time he would come down the hill to sell a bonsai he had cared for and
        cultivated at David Marpas's shop in the centre of the city.
      </p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">
        David Marpas owned a nursery shop that sold various plants and gardening
        supplies. David was a 55-year-old man who was quite famous for his hard
        heart and nose for money, so he had no qualms about buying Mateo's
        bonsai at ridiculously low prices, which he ironically resold at very
        high prices. In addition, Mateo's bonsai sold particularly quickly and
        were highly sought after not only because of the rare species he managed
        to grow but also because the pot in which he managed to beautifully
        present the tree was exquisitely handcrafted by himself.
      </p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">
        David Marpas was once a great botanist, famous for his knowledge of
        trees. He was passionate about climbing and smelling them since he was a
        child. That passion had to take a backseat when he became the father of
        Martina Marpas, who was his most precious treasure, and who at the same
        time forced him to take down his dreams from the trees, to plant them in
        his shop, called "Susana with the black eyes" in honor of the deceased
        wife and mother of his family. The relationship that Mateo had with
        David was curious. David always felt that Mateo was a poor man without
        too many aspirations and felt sorry to see him make deals at very low
        prices for species that both knew could be quite valuable.
      </p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">
        Still, there were things that caught David's attention about Mateo. It
        wasn't just his humility and lack of ambition, but also his vast
        knowledge, as well as his strange ability to recognize species at a
        glance without having to identify the foliage of a plant. He recognized
        diseases and ailments of the same almost just by getting close to them.
        Deep down, David enjoyed talking to Mateo. He represented more than an
        enigma; he was someone with whom to discuss what he was most passionate
        about: trees and plants. Mateo was the only one who had solved the
        enigma of the name of the store, which was not only the name of his
        beloved wife, but also the name of a climbing plant, which was David's
        favorite hobby as a child.
      </p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">
        Martina Marpas was a twenty-three-year-old university student studying
        Environmental Engineering. Despite her father's influence, Martina had
        always had a certain apathy towards her father's closeness to plants.
        She led a fairly normal life for the planet we live on. Her dreams were
        practically normal for any human being: to have a university degree,
        have a good job, earn a lot of money, have an important boyfriend and
        marry him, have children and live in that world that anyone would want.
      </p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">
        The relationship between Martina and Mateo was non-existent, tending to
        fail completely. She saw Mateo simply as a poor person begging for money
        with a couple of plants in his hands. There were no traces of sympathy
        between Martina and Mateo. In fact, Mateo never showed much interest in
        Martina, even though she, with her wavy light brown hair almost on the
        verge of being blonde, her average height, or her thin and fine figure,
        her turned-up nose or her deep blue eyes, had enough reasons for no man
        to ignore her. Despite this, Mateo seemed not to feel much interest in
        her, in getting to know her or talking to her, even when Martina tried
        to enter into the deep botanical conversations between him and his
        father. And it was true, Mateo's shyness could very easily be seen
        externally as the simplest act of disinterest and contempt.
      </p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">
        After returning home from the day of selling bonsais and the endless
        conversations with David Marpas, Mateo began the slow ascent through the
        streets of Valparaiso at a slow and calm pace. His step reflected peace,
        but his lowered gaze, one of those that try not to make contact with the
        gaze of others, made one see a person who stood out curiously among the
        rest, but there were few people who knew him well enough to take that
        for a fact.
      </p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">
        Coming home was always the same and routine, at least for Mateo. He
        would open the door slowly because he knew he had some plants that would
        be bothered by seeing one of their leaves compromised by the movement of
        the door. The house was quite bright, full of skylights built one by one
        at different times and with different materials, the number of specimens
        would impress the most fanatic of plants. The house itself was quite
        full of small holes and twisted and separated boards, it was noticeable
        that it was an old house, but the plants somehow grew and found the
        perfect and harmonious place to live there. Each hole that could have
        let water in during a rain was covered by a plant that occupied that
        filtration to fill itself with nutrients, and each separated and twisted
        board was covered with some humble and leafy vine or flower plant to
        prevent the entry of cold wind during winter.
      </p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">
        The side of the house that faced the hillside had an impressive view of
        Valparaiso and a great view of the sea that borders the port city. On
        that same side of the house there was a small balcony that was commonly
        used by stray cats that in some strange way always took refuge there in
        the cold, and often without it as well.
      </p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">
        Despite everything, the area where a normal human should live was
        somehow strange, in harmony with the lush natural environment of the
        house. Mateo's bed, despite its humility, was quite tidy and clean, free
        of any dirt, plants or water. The dining table that very often served as
        a desk and work table was also free of the presence of anything that was
        not human. The wooden floor, despite the vegetal presence, was shiny and
        the bathroom was also ordinary.
      </p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">
        Life was happy under this basic but strange routine for Mateo, his
        neighborhood accepted him and even felt affection for him and his
        strange abode. Even the children tended to snoop around there. But it
        was one cloudy Monday afternoon when Mateo's life changed forever, when
        out of nowhere, while he was checking some of his plants, in the middle
        of the rain that was falling loudly on the roof of the house, Mateo
        heard a desperate knocking on the front door. When he opened it, he
        found Martina Marpas and in her hands a bonsai broken in half.
      </p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">
        -My boyfriend broke it by accident,- Martina's expression was
        inexplicably strange, especially the mixture of the deep blue eyes that
        sharpened with a strange but curious look towards the interior of the
        house full of plants, - Can you fix it? - she replied.
      </p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">
        -I think so, come in, go ahead- Mateo answered, with his normal hint of
        shyness.
      </p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">
        "Let me see it," Mateo said as he slowly picked up the flowerpot with
        the damaged plant half by half.
      </p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">
        -If my father finds out that I broke that bonsai, he'll kill me- Martina
        spoke, but she was really interested in seeing how Mateo's home
        coexisted with the plants, which made all the water enter, reaching one
        plant or another. It was a spectacle.
      </p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">
        -You'll have to leave him with me for a couple of days, until I see that
        he's okay and I'll give him back to you- said Mateo, giving a ruthless
        diagnosis of the situation.
      </p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">
        Martina stared at him, mostly curious about how someone so young could
        live in such a harmoniously natural environment like that, in the middle
        of the city. But Martina's attention was slightly shocked when Mateo
        turned around to check his tools. The t-shirt he was wearing, which he
        had picked up from the church, showed the remains of a print on the back
        that said "sex instructor," which caused both amusement and repulsion to
        Martina, who was not used to that type of aesthetics and fashion sense.
      </p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">
        -Do you have a phone so we can ask you when to come?- Martina asked as
        she searched her light brown bag for her cell phone.
      </p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">
        -No.- Mateo stared very sincerely into Martina's eyes, and she paused
        for a moment in silence to observe the light brown eyes that scrutinized
        her in such a profound way that she felt the strange need to look away
        from there and continue searching in her bag.
      </p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">
        -Then give me your cell phone number.- Martina said while the movement
        of a lot of things inside could still be heard.
      </p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">
        -I don't have a cell phone.- Mateo's gaze was still staring at her, and
        Martina once again met his gaze without realizing it. She asked:
      </p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">
        -So how do they locate you? Or how can I locate you?
      </p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">- I'm always here- said Mateo.</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">
        -Well, then I'll have to come in a couple of days. I guess I'll meet you
        here, until then, see you later, I have to leave quickly.
      </p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">
        -See you later.- Mateo had barely finished saying these words when
        Martina had already closed her door.
      </p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">
        Anyone would say that this was a gesture of contempt, but Mateo
        understood in his heart the repulsion that Martina felt in some way
        inside, or the fear that curiosity about Mateo's life produced in her.
        But even so, there he was, making mental calculations of Martina's
        attitude when he heard a slight croak. And he thought:
      </p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">-A frog? Here?...</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">
        It didn't take long for him to figure out that the croaking was coming
        from the broken bonsai he had in his hand. When he brought it close to
        his eye, he saw a frog of about 5cm, bright green and with deep red
        eyes, which was watching him with great relaxation from the wet earth
        and moss of the bonsai. The animal was totally out of place in the area
        and geographical location, so this created an enigma and a fun mental
        exercise for Mateo. When he saw it more closely and examined it, Mateo
        couldn't help but smile and say to the wind:
      </p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">-You are a rather ugly but cute little animal.</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">
        But amidst the croaking, the frog answered him clearly.
      </p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">
        -You say it like your hair matches your ugly face.
      </p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

      <a id="c2">II</a>

      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">
        How is your faith these days, Father? was a phrase that was going around
        in the head of a young parish priest in the city of Valparaiso. Although
        he had felt the call of God at the early age of 12, at that time his
        faith was under a strict regime of questioning. Franco felt the
        responsibility of a strong and very loyal Christian community that
        always sought his advice and help, which, on the other hand, kept his
        mind busy enough to keep him away from the cracks that had very subtly
        formed in that wall in his head called Faith in God.
      </p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">
        The point was not that Father Franco's faith was not ill-founded from
        the beginning, in fact everything had happened suddenly, but at the same
        time at a very slow and subtle pace. It began with the arrival of a
        strange man, in fact, no one saw him arrive. He simply began to live in
        the abandoned house that was at the end of El Roble Street, the old
        house that for decades no one claimed and that no one cared about, that
        old house that was so small that no one was interested in fixing it up
        or even taking it as property. He simply took that house and began to
        fix it up, he raised it almost from the ruins.
      </p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">
        Soon after, people in the neighborhood began to look at the house
        strangely. All the stray cats and dogs seemed to want to sleep nearby.
        The few rumors that were circulating were positive because Valparaiso at
        that time was already known for the number of stray animals it had
        roaming its streets and at least one person who sympathized with them in
        some way or another made the community, or a good part of it, see it as
        something positive.
      </p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">
        Soon the rumour of a man who helped animals from his poverty began to
        bounce around on everyone's lips, it was even said that wounded animals
        would arrive at his house on their own to be cured. Some began to call
        him a saint, others called him a witch, but the result was always the
        same silence and enigma generated by that man with his almost senile
        appearance who rarely left his house to feed the dogs.
      </p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">
        Father Franco was always reluctant to get involved in neighborhood
        gossip, rumors and gossip were too often and in great quantity around
        his church and his charity food kitchen. Everyone who came there brought
        their own stories, each one more extraordinary and more incredible than
        the last, so Franco already had a thick skin against extraordinary
        tales. But there was one rumor that was hitting him in the head, and it
        was about an old man who appeared out of nowhere on El Roble Street, who
        out of nowhere appeared in the small abandoned house, almost in ruins,
        and who restored it by raising it from its very foundations.
      </p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">
        The young priest had a burning desire to meet such a man, but he knew
        that if he brought the sight and patience of his parishioners to that
        house, he would only further ignite the flame of rumors of holy events
        or things coming from heaven. So he used his sharp and keen cunning,
        which had been evident from an early age from time to time, and took
        advantage of a Tuesday, since on Tuesdays his church opened its kitchen
        to homeless people and people in need by helping them with a plate of
        food. He knew that this mysterious man would appear; his instinct told
        him yes.
      </p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">
        The wait that Tuesday morning was not too long; before the kitchen
        opened there was already a line of poor but strangely happy people
        outside the church, waiting amid laughter and greetings among
        themselves, as if they were a single community brought together by
        adversity.

      <p class="MsoNormal">
        At 9 o'clock in the morning sharp, the doors of the church opened.
        People entered, chatting and shaking hands with Father Franco, who had
        strategically placed himself at the entrance of the dining room to see
        the face of each person who arrived. It was not difficult to distinguish
        the person he was looking for from the rest; among all the homeless
        people there was one person who was clearly different from the others.
        He was a man with long dark hair and a medium-length beard, quite neat
        compared to what Franco was used to seeing on the days of the open
        kitchen at the church. As he walked in, his presence was strange,
        somewhere between threatening and peaceful, but definitely a person who
        made himself known without saying a single word; his height was about
        six feet, and on his face you could see a marked map of future wrinkles
        showing that he was around forty-five to fifty years old. His eyes, deep
        brown, did not focus on one point, he did not look at anyone and tried
        not to make eye contact with anyone. He advanced slowly, dressed in very
        torn pants, a rather worn T-shirt with visible holes in it, but what
        stood out the most was a large old blanket that he used as a hood to
        cover his entire body and part of his head and face. The blanket was
        quite shabby, in fact it could be mistaken for an old carpet or an
        overused rug, but what was abnormal for that environment was that the
        holes, which were several and some quite large, were covered with
        branches intertwined with each other in a very precise order that worked
        as a totally simple cover.
      </p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">
        Mrs. Margot, the lady who volunteered to serve the food from the large
        pot where the food was cooked, was obviously surprised and frightened
        when she saw this man approaching with a tray with an empty plate and a
        loaf of bread on one side. She stared at him. From his appearance she
        recognized him as the person who helped the animals and offered him a
        smile and she said to him "Thank you very much, good man, for everything
        you do for the creatures."The man only gave back a reassuring and
        peaceful smile and soon returned to an empty table to sit down to eat.
      </p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">
        Franco knew that this was the right moment to meet him, so he approached
        him, took the chair next to him and said very discreetly:
      </p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">
        "On behalf of the entire community, I wanted to thank you for what
        you've done for stray animals," Franco said from a safe distance.
      </p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">-You're welcome...- the man said tersely.</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">
        -My name is Franco, I am the parish priest of this church.
      </p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">
        -I know who he is, I know that he is the representative of the Christian
        God in the religious sector. - these words sounded rude, but they did
        not frighten Franco.
      </p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">
        -It sounds a bit crude to call it that, but yes, I am a representative
        of the Christian faith.
      </p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">
        -My name is Anibal.- he said timidly while dipping a piece of bread into
        the soup.
      </p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">
        -Nice to meet you, Anibal. I'd like to know more about you, where you
        come from, what you do.
      </p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">
        -I would rather tell you that I come from far away and I dedicate myself
        to observing things.
      </p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">
        -That sounds a bit volatile, you see, I want to see a way to help you.-
        <span>Franco said very confidently, but was quickly interrupted.</span>
      </p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">
        -You are wrong, I am the one who has come to help you...- these words
        produced a lapse of confusion but also triggered a certain impatience.
      </p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">
        -Look, you don't strike me as an alcoholic, or a drug addict, or a
        timeless madman, I've heard too many similar things in this kitchen. If
        you want to help, it seems like a very noble task, but what I'm trying
        to tell you is that I've heard many things about you and those things
        are good, you've helped animals and you took back a house that was in
        ruins and began to rebuild it and give shape and life to the street
        where you live. But let us help you, if you are a positive agent, I
        would love to help you in any way I can.- Father Franco took a breath
        after finishing this sentence.
      </p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">
        -Okay, I'll allow you to help me, but you must remain silent and not ask
        too many questions and I think that because of your religious background
        you must have experience in this.
      </p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">
        -That's right, tell me what you need and I'll see how to help you.-
        Franco felt a little more relieved to feel a little more sympathy from
        Anibal.
      </p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">
        -I just need help finishing my house. If you have some materials to give
        me, it would be very helpful. and containers, pots for the soil. oh and
        organic things, scraps, fruit peels that I don't use and things like
        that.
      </p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">
        Anibal stared blankly at Franco, who only let out a laugh and patted
        Anibal on the back.
      </p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">
        -Everyone here wants money, they want money for everything, and you ask
        me for soil and flower pots, I will definitely help you, you definitely
        seem like a unique man to me.
      </p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">
        Franco stood up but turned around with his hand on his chin as if
        remembering something.
      </p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">
        -Before you go, I'll give you some clothes that arrive here every so
        often, very few people want them, I think fashion sense influences even
        the most needy. I'll stop by your house later if you don't mind, so we
        can talk and I'll bring you some things too so you can get started on
        whatever you have in mind to do.
      </p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">
        After this, Franco leaves smiling as if he had just chatted with a
        celebrity. As he leaves, Anibal observes him and feels that Franco has
        the need to be part of something extraordinary and that made him feel
        good, and that he had arrived at the right place.
      </p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

      <a id="c3">III</a>

      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">
        The expression on Mateo's face explained his perplexity. Despite being a
        person who was used to extraordinary things, this event shook his brains
        to the point that within his own rationality he did not know which route
        to take. He did not know if he really heard a frog speak or if some part
        of his neurons became confused.
      </p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">
        -Hey, human. if you make that expression every time you see a frog, you
        should do something about the flies, this place is a feast.- It was
        obvious that the frog had not realized that he could hear him either.
      </p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">
        -Can... can... can you talk?...- Mateo was in shock.
      </p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">
        The frog's giant red eyes were absentmindedly rolling around the flies
        in the house before immediately fixing their gaze on Mateo's face.
      </p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">
        -Can you understand me?...- the frog was surprised within his rigid
        expression.
      </p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">-You...can you understand me?...- answered Mateo.</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">
        -Bah, my first conversation with one of those who proclaim themselves
        intelligent beings and all I get is a conversation that goes in
        circles.- the frog said very sure of herself.
      </p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">-But, this is... fantastic, you can talk!</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">
        -Talk?... Everyone talks, human, the question is what language they
        speak... frogs speak in frog language, like dogs speak in dog language
        and cats in cat language...
      </p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">
        -But how is it that you can speak a language that I understand.- Mateo
        said as he carefully placed the bonsai on the small table next to the
        patched window of his house and sat down to look at it and examine it
        with quick glances around its body that was at the bottom of the pot.
      </p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">
        -I'm not speaking in any special human language, I'm speaking in my
        native language, you're the one who can understand me in some paranormal
        way.
      </p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">
        -But if that were the case, I could understand the dogs and cats there.
      </p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">-Don't ask me, I just do what a frog does...</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">
        -And how can you understand what I say?- Mateo asked immediately.
      </p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">
        -Most animals can understand human language, their language is quite
        archaic and essential, but personally, let's say that I have dedicated
        myself to educating myself in human matters, I am a very educated frog.
      </p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">
        Mateo remained suspended in his thoughts trying to swallow this abnormal
        situation and at the same time trying to understand what this was all
        about.
      </p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">
        "Well, I don't know what you'll have to do now, but I have to eat, I
        hope you don't mind if the fly population decreases," said the frog, to
        which he received a distracted silence in response.
      </p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">
        -What's your name?...- said Mateo, staring at the frog.
      </p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">-My name is Mo, what is yours, human?</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">-Mateo</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">-Nice to be able to talk to you Mateo.</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">
        -I guess it's a pleasure for me too,- said Mateo while scratching his
        messy hair, -Now, I guess you can stay here as long as you're careful,
        there are plenty of plants for you to live in,- said Mateo as he began
        to examine the damaged Bonsai with a small magnifying glass he kept in
        his pocket.
      </p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">
        -It has some broken branches, uhmmm a major crack at the main apex, a
        bit of lifting at the roots. I wonder what the hell they were doing when
        this happened.
      </p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">
        "They were arguing, she and her breeding male," Mo said as he began to
        look for a good spot by moving in short jumps on the table.
      </p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">
        <span
          >-Male breeder, you mean her boyfriend, right?- Mateo said, paying
          attention to her.</span

      <p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">
        <span
          >-Oh yeah, that's it, I don't really understand the human mating
          system, but I know he was her mate,- said Mo as she kept her gaze
          fixed on a careless fly on the window,- they were arguing and yelling,
          and he tried to do something rough and she pushed him away and he
          almost sat on the bonsai and on me.</span

          understand you. I was once in a similar situation, the frog I liked

          Bonsai. -How did a frog like you get here? I mean, I know a little

          the bag.</span

          long conversations between frog and human, for Mateo something was
          changing in his placid routine as a grower and plant expert. The
          neighborhood began to talk again between gossip and once again the
          target of this was him, this time on several occasions when he was
          seen talking to the cats and dogs of the place. The worst of all was
          that Mateo was indeed talking to a black cat with gray spots that had
          the habit of sleeping shamelessly stretched out next to the door of
          his house, there where the sun hit all day. He didn't do it just once,
          it was many times. He tried to talk to it and kept trying and the cat
          just looked at him carefree to continue grooming itself as if nothing
          had happened.</span

          soil that he created himself by burying food scraps, namely fruit and
          vegetable peels and rotting food in certain places in his cramped
          yard. This process produced compost in two months, an essential

          soaking in a small glass container with a stone and water, when
          something in the air, something instinctive began to call his
          attention and immediately caused him to look up and begin to look at
          the entire horizon. Something was about to happen but he didn't know
          what, so he decided to ignore his instinct and continued doing his
          chores and bury what should become compost in the future.</span

          remove. He checked a small greenhouse created only from supermarket
          bags where he had some tomatoes and some vegetables for his own food.
          He maintained some of his bonsais that were arranged on a handmade
          shelf on the wall that looked out onto his house's patio. He went
          through his normal daily routine and felt satisfied inside, so he went
          to take a quick shower, as expected, so he could cook dinner for the
          night that was quickly falling with a crimson color on the

          started knocking on the door. Mateo knew it wasn't someone he knew
          because of the way he knocked, something inside him began to give him
          a hunch that it wasn't someone ordinary either. He slowly approached
          the door, while he managed to concentrate on doing something. Mateo
          took an old stick that he had near the window and approached it to see
          something and only distinguished a strange silhouette that he wasn't
          used to seeing, he took a couple of steps and filled himself with
          courage and took it to his arm, where he reached out his hand and
          quickly opened the door.</span

          >The door rang with a subtle and timid sound; the day was covered by
          clouds that threatened to bring rain and painted the scene in gray.
          The young father Franco did not expect the answer to the door he was
          knocking on to take so long, for a moment he thought of leaving, but
          the door rang with a violent creak and began to open, the swollen wood
          did not allow it to open completely. Behind this image began to appear
          the silhouette of a thin and upright man, it was Anibal with his
          strange presence who made a subtle gesture to enter Franco who was
          carrying a couple of bags with containers and plastic bowls as well as
          a couple of small pots.</span

        <span
          >Upon entering, the scene was strange, the work of rebuilding a small
          abandoned house seemed titanic, too much for just one man, the floor
          still looked like it was made of dirt and the wood that once served
          that purpose was still nowhere to be seen. There were remains of bags,
          boxes, tetra packs, plastic bottles and various garbage everywhere,
          the smell was unbearable, but despite that the work was going quite
          well. Anibal was with a couple of bags in his hands and was sorting
          the trash. In one corner were the empty bottles and plastic
          containers, in another were the tetra pack boxes, in another place the
          bags and in a giant bag was a bad-smelling set of organic garbage,
          various things that showed different degrees of decomposition.</span

          put the bags aside. The smell had hit him full force, he wasn't used
          to it, but Anibal's look made him feel that he was either part of the
          solution or he was simply a nuisance like any old bag lying on the
          floor. So Franco immediately said:</span

          when I arrived. According to what the locals say, it had been
          unoccupied for much longer, and no one knows exactly what happened to
          the owners or who the occupants of this house were- said Franco while
          opening the bags with the things he had brought with him.</span

          another place where there is more trash and pretending that that place
          with trash doesn't exist and forgetting about it... is not disposing
          of the trash, it is simply being unconscious and living at the expense
          of your own unconsciousness. - Anibal's words sounded louder than any
          mass sermon.</span

          him the simplest of reasons. At one point when Anibal was carrying the
          second large bag with organic waste, he tried to inquire into the most
          basic curiosity.</span

          lies, and instead of accepting it, they collect garbage and forget it
          in some common place, and thus their own waste does not ruin their

          hippie who died during the dictatorship several decades ago, appeared

          the silence at dinner. The table with plates with one place less, the
          silence still there for years, like a rotten visitor, and for that

          sensations, faith, and the question of why he is a priest, his faith
          was falling one grain of sand at a time on a wall a hundred meters

          children were playing as on any other day, and Father Franco smiled
          next to them and greeted the ladies who approached him from the doors
          and windows. The whispers did not let themselves be hidden, seeing a
          young priest, with his collar half loose on a loose black shirt and
          with a shovel on his back and gardening gloves. It was very curious,
          but when reaching the end of the street the attention was inevitably
          stolen by the scene that was presented, outside the house there were
          at least five stray dogs sleeping at the entrance of the house with a
          small water fountain made from bottles. It looked pretty good and the
          dogs seemed grateful within the laziness that they communicated in
          their careless poses on the ground. Looking up at the ceiling of the
          house he noticed that there were also around seven or eight cats
          sleeping as calmly as their canine comrades and a brown one was
          looking down at him with a listless face while grooming its

          more food than this one, they preferred to spend the heat here, in the
          poorest one. He came to think that there was something supernatural in
          the presence of the animals, but that thought alone made him smile
          halfway as he knocked on the door and petted a dog that from its still
          lazy position on the ground raised its head with its ears back,

          a small but fierce predator, which gave it the determination and
          agility to quickly dodge the roots that were too slow for its superior
          maneuverability. When the third root tried to hit it, the fox climbed
          onto the root itself to jump a few meters and drop directly on Mateo.

          rabbit by the ears from inside the hat, regardless of the trick he
          uses to perform it. You call that magic because in your little minds
          you cannot explain the logic of how a rabbit can come out of a hat

          spacious and the surface was inclined downwards, following the natural
          slope of the hill where the house was located. The weeds were huge,
          more than a meter high; the trees stood humbly, half-wiry due to the
          lack of nutrients and somewhat timid among the grass; next to the

          ramblings while he dug. They made two holes in the ground, in one they
          buried the organic waste from the house and in the second and smaller
          one Anibal gathered the weeds that he pulled out with his hands helped
          by a couple of bags that he had to protect it.</span

          Anibal's presence, his mysterious arrival, and his unexpected stay

          sick and retired to his bedroom, with the futile plan of sleeping
          early and thus solving the problem by ignoring it. But sleep never
          came, the night fell at a slow pace, and when it was almost midnight,
          his mind could not stop thinking about what it would be, or what it
          would be like, what he could see in Anibal's house. His mind wandered
          from the most supernatural possibilities to the most terrifying ones

          body, put it in a jacket, groped for his socks in the dark,
          unwittingly choosing one blue and one gray, put on the collar-raiser
          wrong. He put on his shoes awkwardly, fixing them as he left the
          bedroom, walked through the church atrium, where he crossed himself as

          plants that needed water more often than the others. As he passed in

          world. She had learned to create a mask of calm and indifference that
          had become more and more embedded in her character, to the point that
          it was very difficult for her to take it off to show the person she
          really was.</span

          >Martina was a very restless girl with a very volatile imagination.
          She always felt that her mother was watching her, that she was
          somewhere with her. She used to have an imaginary friend whom she
          called "Manu" but as she grew up and was exposed to the environment of
          her school and college, he began to disappear. In her adolescence,
          despite being a very sociable and normal girl, she liked to believe in
          aliens, UFOs, ghosts, goblins, gnomes, all kinds of paranormal things.
          She believed that all things had life, she felt that the supernatural
          was everywhere but she was only a centimeter away from discovering
          them. However, it was the scientific upbringing that her father gave
          her that took the patience to kill one by one the beliefs that she had
          treasured since childhood, to the point that one day, without anything
          particular happening to cause it, she decided to put aside everything
          strange about her. She assumed that believing in things that other
          people don't believe was a sign of immaturity. You couldn't say that
          it made her mature, but it made her blend more accurately into the
          world she was looking for, or at least she thought she was looking
          for. This is where Mateo played a strange role, because at first
          glance he symbolized everything she had left behind, a direct
          communication with the core that needed to believe in something.</span

          can think of is that, of all the coffee that can be bought, one coffee
          bean is poorly roasted, and for that to happen I imagine it would have

          intelligent, and we tell ourselves that we are alone on this planet,
          but this planet is full of life, everywhere, and each and every
          manifestation of this world wants to communicate something to us, each
          one has emotions, ambitions, but we are quick to assume that they are
          lesser, just because we don't understand them, everything is based on
          that, we demand that the world understands us, but we can't even

          stood up like such. Anibal turned towards Franco and walked towards
          him, the glow emitted by his silhouette was imperceptible, but it was
          still present. Each step he took against the ground made small plants
          grow around his feet. Despite everything, Franco managed to uselessly
          mix the image of his brother with that of some saint, or something

          the only ones who adopted druidic beliefs, they were an aristocratic
          class among them, and there the skill as an academy was greatly
          developed, the word druid means in Celtic "rich in knowledge". And
          regarding the other, let's say that where I come from, I am a
          dedicated druid, I consider myself above average in what I do.</span

          blocks from his destination, he could make out a very subtle white
          glow between the grass on the sidewalk, especially in the dark parts
          of the street. As he got closer, he realized that it was something
          very strange. He was horrified to see that from all the dark parts of
          the sidewalks and streets, strange, thick, white, squiggly lines began
          to appear, moving at a disconcerting pace, and more and more of them
          appeared. Franco truly believed that he was going crazy. So he decided
          to run home as best he could, but he saw that these things were
          everywhere. They didn't seem numerous, but they were in almost all the
          dark and semi-dark places he saw. He knew deep down that it had
          something to do with what he had witnessed that day. So he preferred
          to lock himself in his room and sleep until the next day so he could
          ask Anibal the pertinent questions.</span

          asleep, when he opened his eyes he just lay motionless staring at the
          back of the room in search of some sign that would tell him that
          everything that had happened the night before had been a dream, but no
          such sign ever came. It was around nine thirty in the morning and
          Franco definitely did not want to get up, he did not want to be
          himself, he did not want to play his role that day, but it was too

          going about his business without saying much. A part of him was giving
          up, he thought he was going crazy. Those serpentine, white, shiny

          uneasy as he realized that his role as a priest was really or should
          be the ancestral heritage of being the intermediary between his God
          and his parishioners. The fact that this work brought him very close
          and created a perfect analogy for what a druid should originally be,
          disturbed him even more. He felt that, without realizing it, someone
          had turned on a light that was always there but for which no one had
          found the switch to turn it on. And in that light he felt that
          technically he was also a druid, but whose order was Christian, this
          produced a contradiction that made him feel that his faith was dirty,
          and it always was, it was a different crisis than believing or not
          believing, this time he wondered if he should believe the way he was
          supposed to believe.</span

          afternoon he dedicated himself to sorting out the paperwork for the
          church to forget about his doubts for a while, but even so he had
          already decided to go visit Anibal once more.</span

          almost immediately. When it finished opening, the first image Franco

          so far apart? In other words, one thing that has become clear is that
          man is incapable of creating things from his imagination alone, even

          at the other end of the line we put humans, as the most distant thing

          us, because we can see them naturally, then, halfway along the line to

          cancutro, which is a small imperceptible entity that gets into the
          left ear of its victim and parasitizes the delight of sound, its
          presence really isn't very alarming, but you can suffer from a lot of

        <span

          loud, -what torments me is why they are appearing in the city, that is
          totally unnatural for a bicho, they don't like noise, nor cement.

          animal says, it is about each animal speaking its own language and

          druid orders to its cause, and the idea has taken hold strongly, there

          approaching him and handing him an object. Then, behind her there was
          a river of light falling down the street where Anibal and Franco were
          standing, suddenly the scene changed to the image of Martina screaming
          and stretching out her hand while he walked backwards; but what
          disturbed him the most was that suddenly in his dream a cat, or lynx,
          appeared; he could not identify it because it was ethereal and its
          contours were drawn in yellowish colors.</span

          understand what he was saying. In the dream, Mateo took a few steps to
          try to hear better, and the background around him changed, but the cat
          was still there, and he tried to talk and get closer to Mateo, and the
          cat leaned down and lunged at him. Mateo could feel the pain as the
          animal sank its fangs into his neck and its claws slowly tore open his
          flesh while he could only stay still. Behind the cat, the image of
          Martina screaming and reaching out her hand began to flash again as if
          everything was happening in slow motion, but the pain became too real
          at one point, and when Mateo raised his hands in the air, he realized
          that he had woken up, but the dream had not been normal.</span

          had to talk about this with someone, he looked at the corner of the
          house where Vilu was sleeping, even though he had just arrived, he
          felt comfortable with him, but even so, there were parts of himself
          that he found difficult to share with others. In any case, Vilu was
          the only person he could talk about these things with, but he would do
          so in the morning. At that moment he just went back to sleep, hoping
          not to dream about the same thing again.</span

          constant transformation, inside he was still digesting the information

          about and could not get a clear idea, he was still quite confused with
          everything that had happened. At times he felt like he was losing
          faith, but when he looked up at the end of the last sentence of the
          reading, he managed to make out a man at the back of the church, with
          long hair tied back, clean and dressed as elegantly as he could for

          was, - but we have forgotten something very important, our home, the
          home that was lent to us to walk our way back to heaven; we have not

          about. Anibal left silently, and was pleased to see how the people who

          lives. Of course, it was not a drastic or strong change, but it was
          slowly developing.</span

          happy with the look and perspective that he saw that Franco had
          adopted. The afternoon passed calmly, Anibal dedicated himself to
          collecting seeds, rummaging through the garbage and looking in the
          corners for remains of apples, tomatoes, or fruit to plant. He found
          several that would help him, he had already prepared many flowerpots
          made from disposable bottles, cardboard boxes and other containers. He
          planted the seeds carefully, making a hole in the ground with the tip
          of his index finger previously moistened, then he placed the seeds one
          by one in the number of flowerpots that he had prepared.</span

          up from the window and noticed the dark tone of the night passing by
          on the street. He went about his routine as always, things like
          cleaning the floor with a broom improvised with branches tied to a
          larger stick, which despite everything, in operation was just as good
          as any traditional broom.</span

          there was still too much work to be done in the house for it to look

          could be seen that showed he had been crying a lot. His hair was
          completely white and of medium length, but noticeably dirty, and his

          was terrified; he thought the boy would drop dead at any moment,
          seeing that his eyes were rolled back in his head and the evidence of

          bed made of blankets, lying in sleep with his eyes open towards
          nothing. The screams were heartbreaking. The child tried to hold his
          stomach while gagging with his tongue almost bursting from the
          pressure; his eyes were fixed on nothing, as if he were concentrating
          as much as possible on calming his childish body from the pain. Anibal

          screaming, but his body began to shiver, and from the shivering he
          went on to strong jerks to the point of convulsing uncontrollably on
          the ground. Anibal approached timidly, with his eyes closed and
          holding his breath, he knew that the bicho that Mateo was expelling
          was Lieviel, a common bicho but very difficult to fight, and at the
          same time very aggressive, whose objective was to feed on any feeling
          of joy from the body of its victim, leaving that person's mood on the
          floor, and in a permanent depression without too much warning that
          could end up in suicide attempts; of all the bichos that Anibal knew,
          excluding Minmenio, Lieviel was one of the most dangerous clearly
          because of the collateral damage of its presence. The purging of this
          bicho was by far one of the most terrible, apparently, the
          disconnection of all the sensitive and emotional parts of its victim
          made the departure of the bicho terrible and very painful.</span

          bicho began to come out like a river from Mateo's body, and when it

          part, remained motionless, with his eyes half closed and his arms

          bicho which immediately made him a possible victim for it. Very slowly
          Anibal began to close his right eye and open his left one, he knew
          that most bichos had more difficulties attacking a body through the
          left eye. Then, very slowly he moved his hands forward with his palm

          rather liquid form, moving from one place in the room to another
          through the air, like a jet of water or something more viscous than
          that. The speed of the bicho was very fast, but Anibal concentrated
          very skillfully at the last instant before the impact and from the
          ground, in a thousandth of a second, a wooden staff appeared, breaking
          through the ground and instantly reaching his hand. The staff seemed
          to be a root or a branch, with a very twisted shape at its top and at
          its bottom it was narrow but very hard, as if it had a naturally grown
          tip. With this element in his hand, Anibal managed to create a kind of
          very subtle and invisible protective field, but one that made the
          shock with the bicho that tried to penetrate this barrier and reach
          Anibal's eye shine.</span

          had given way. At that moment Anibal concentrated again on a last
          effort and from the tip of his staff came an incandescent light that
          blinked three times strongly, in those three times the bicho retreated

          staff between him and the bicho, and now Anibal thought of a stronger
          alternative, he concentrated and began to stare at the tip of his
          staff where the bicho was. Suddenly it released a small explosion and
          showed fire. The fire seemed to dance very calmly on the tip of the
          staff, and the bicho seemed to hate it as it got off it and stayed on

          control, fire was not governed by the laws of balance, as he himself
          had learned "fire when it appears only thinks about burning", so he
          knew that if he used that spell wrong, he could end up with the house
          on fire or perhaps the entire block or hill; it was difficult for him
          to foresee the fire because when it was invoked by a druid, fire
          became aware of itself, and this awareness was not peaceful.</span

          lodged itself in the ceiling where it was preparing to attack, but it
          didn't have much of an escape route. In his struggle, Anibal realized
          that the fire on his staff had spread, so he knew that the fight had
          to end soon, or the fire could get out of control; he opened his palm

          he, being a world-famous druid, still didn't understand. He knew that
          what he saw was Minmenio devouring Lieviel, he had heard that bichos
          could devour and consume other bichos, but what caught his attention
          most heavily was Mateo's symbiosis with Minmenio. From all he knew, he
          had never heard or would have imagined that a bicho could symbiotize
          with a human, or could be used or used as a tool by him.</span

          very closely, but at a prudent distance.</span

          could also express his joy by playing in the yard under the gaze of
          the druid. The smile that appeared on Mateo's face, something totally
          new for everyone, seemed to come as a breath of fresh air in the face
          of so much pain and suffering concentrated in one small being. Anibal
          hoped that Mateo's situation would improve with the days, and so it
          did, the days went by and Mateo played freely morning and afternoon in
          the yard of the house.</span

          boy's life, but Anibal was still too curious and alarmed by the
          presence of Minmenio, the memory devourer, and his supposed symbiosis
          with Mateo. Apart from that, there was a new sign in Mateo that Anibal
          found strange; every so often, and without warning, Mateo would
          freeze, staring at the sky, or he would also freeze, staring at the
          landscape with a gaze lost in the void; but within a minute he would
          regain his childish smile and continue running with a stick he found
          lying around.</span

          inevitably, perhaps because of all the adversities they went through
          together. Anibal could not help but laugh out loud at some of Mateo's
          madness, who already felt Anibal as his closest family. Anibal wanted
          to see Minmenio's reaction again, but he sensed that to invoke the
          help of the beast, Mateo would have to be in a situation of great
          stress, rage, anger or some strong emotion, at least that was Anibal's
          hypothesis.</span

          even larger landscape, one afternoon, almost at dusk, when the sky was
          painted crimson red, but mixed with blue tones, when Anibal was under
          the chestnut tree nibbling on some grass and watching Mateo from a
          distance, who was running around laughing with a stick, pretending to
          be Anibal and fighting imaginary bichos. At that moment, Mateo stopped
          looking at the sky, and with a very marked face of astonishment;
          Anibal had already seen that reaction, he even found it funny.</span

          child and his imagination, but he decided to focus a little more. By
          concentrating a little, he managed to see a couple of flashes coming
          from the hills that made up the majestic horizon of Valparaiso. Then
          Anibal understood that this was not something simply superficial, and
          he fixed his gaze there on part of the hill where he had seen
          something strange, concentrating a lot, he managed to begin to make
          out the silhouette of a giant snake, very giant, of an immeasurable
          size, that slept coiled up, completely covering the top of an entire
          hill in Valparaiso.</span

          the sight of a giant snake, which was not perceptible to the common
          human eye; and that it was probably a wandering bicho that decided to
          rest on that hill for the night. What disturbed him was Mateo's high
          capacity, at his young age, to be able to see planes invisible to
          humans, and practically invisible to him as a druid; the idea of his
          development seemed gigantic to him. Regarding the snake, Anibal knew
          that it was called Porta and that it was a giant, flying bicho shaped
          like a white snake, but he also knew that only some experienced and
          famous druids had achieved a degree of connection such as to be able
          to see it; many tried and went insane because they could not control
          the amount of images they could see.</span
